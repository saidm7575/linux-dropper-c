## Overview

This project is a simple Linux dropper utility written in C.
It demonstrates secure file handling, basic obfuscation, process execution, and loggingâ€”intended for security research, C learning, and portfolio use.

---

## Features

* Reads a user-supplied executable file from disk
* Applies simple XOR obfuscation and de-obfuscation (for demonstration)
* Saves the file to a randomized path in `/tmp`
* Executes the dropped file and waits for its completion
* Logs all actions and errors to `/tmp/downloader.log`
* Optionally deletes the dropped file after execution (`--cleanup`)
* Optionally self-deletes the dropper itself after running (`--self-remove`)

---

## Usage

```bash
gcc dropper.c -o dropper
./dropper <input_file> [--cleanup] [--self-remove]
```

**Example:**

```bash
./dropper ./hello --cleanup
```

**Options:**

* `--cleanup` : Remove dropped file after execution.
* `--self-remove` : Dropper deletes itself after running (be careful).

---

## How It Works

1. Reads the given executable file into memory.
2. Obfuscates the file content using XOR.
3. De-obfuscates it (for demonstration).
4. Saves to a random filename in `/tmp`.
5. Executes the dropped file.
6. Cleans up and logs every step.
